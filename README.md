This major project focuses on the design and implementation of a Smart Cart using LabVIEW.
In this present generation most of the people prefer to visit supermarkets and hypermarkets to buy the products of their needs right from the food products to the household usage items. In general these hypermarkets and supermarkets provide trolleys to their customers to have a hand free convenient shopping. Though the entire shopping goes well most of the customers get stressed out by seeing those long queues and hours of waiting near the bill counters. Even after coming up with some temporary solutions for this highly time consuming problem like increasing the man power in bill counters it didn’t bring a big difference. The aim of the paper is to overcome this problem with a permanent solution. Here we introduce a new system called <b>“SMART CART”</b> where we can most probably eliminate the time taking process at the counters. This ultimately leads to the customer satisfaction from the starting of the shopping till the end point. And also adds benefits like reduction of man power requirement and high efficiency with low expenses. In this competitive world of technology this brings a drastic change benefiting both customers and also retail industries by the usage of automated devices. The idea is implemented using <b>"LabVIEW software"</b> and <b>"hardware MyRIO"</b>. </p>

 # Introduction
 <p align="justify" >
 In an era where technology continuously evolves to simplify daily tasks and enhance efficiency, the development of smart systems has become increasingly prominent. The project <b>'Design and Implementation of Smart Cart using LabVIEW'</b> aims to integrate advanced technologies into the realm of shopping carts, transforming traditional carts into intelligent, automated assistants. Leveraging the capabilities of LabVIEW, a powerful graphical programming platform, this project endeavors to create a seamless shopping experience by incorporating features such as obstacle detection, automated navigation, and real-time data analysis. By merging cutting-edge hardware with sophisticated software, this endeavor seeks to revolutionize the shopping landscape, offering consumers a glimpse into the future of retail convenience and automation.</p>

# Purpose
The purpose of the smart cart is as shown in below picture.

<p align="justify" >
The motivation behind this venture is to actualize a programmed shopping basket that gives awesome accommodation and proficiency to clients, Help clients effectively find the coveted items. Our objective incorporates keeping away from impacts with obstructions and distinguishing available courses, gathering client input and upgrading the way required to oblige the shopping rundown, and educating client when the truck is blocked.</p>

# Proposed System
<p align="justify"> 
The proposed system aims to revolutionize the shopping experience by introducing a high-tech, cost-effective solution tailored for supermarkets and malls. The Smart Shopping Cart, which has meticulously designed to enhance convenience and security while minimizing theft risks. Leveraging hardware components such as <b>Bluetooth (HC-05), MyRio, and PIR sensor</b>, the system ensures robust performance and seamless integration. MyRio serves as the bridge between hardware and software, facilitating efficient communication. The inclusion of a PIR sensor acts as a deterrent against theft, enhancing the safety of goods within the cart. The software application is developed using Android Studio, offering a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction. Upon scanning a unique QR code assigned to each cart, customers initiate the shopping process. Subsequently, the application establishes a connection between the customer's device and the shopkeeper's MyRio via Bluetooth. This connection enables real-time updates, allowing customers to add or remove items by scanning their barcodes. Upon completion of shopping, customers can signal completion through the app, generating a detailed bill that includes itemized costs and total expenses. Finally, the system streamlines the payment process, offering a hassle-free checkout experience. Through this comprehensive system, the proposed solution aims to elevate the shopping experience, ensuring efficiency, convenience, and security for all stakeholders involved.</p>

# Design and Implementation
