# Design and Implementation of Smart Cart using Labview
<br> This major project focuses on the design and implementation of a Smart Cart using LabVIEW.
In this present generation most of the people prefer to visit supermarkets and hypermarkets to buy the products of their needs right from the food products to the household usage items. In general these hypermarkets and supermarkets provide trolleys to their customers to have a hand free convenient shopping. Though the entire shopping goes well most of the customers get stressed out by seeing those long queues and hours of waiting near the bill counters. Even after coming up with some temporary solutions for this highly time consuming problem like increasing the man power in bill counters it didn’t bring a big difference. The aim of the paper is to overcome this problem with a permanent solution. Here we introduce a new system called **“SMART CART”** where we can most probably eliminate the time taking process at the counters. This ultimately leads to the customer satisfaction from the starting of the shopping till the end point. And also adds benefits like reduction of man power requirement and high efficiency with low expenses. In this competitive world of technology this brings a drastic change benefiting both customers and also retail industries by the usage of automated devices. The idea is implemented using **LabVIEW software** and **hardware MyRIO.** </br>
